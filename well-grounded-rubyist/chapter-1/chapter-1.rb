# Class variables start with @@
# Instance variables start with @
# Global variables start with $

# Almost everything in Ruby is an object
# We can send messages to objects that correspond to subroutines inside of those objects (methods)
#
# Self is the default object, and can change depending on context
#
# A Class is a collection of behavior or functionality
# Every object in Ruby is an instance of exactly one class
#
# Objects can pick up additional methods unconnected with their class after their instantiated
#
# running a ruby file with the -cw flag performs a syntax check without actually running the file
